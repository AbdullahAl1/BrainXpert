This project involves the development of a deep learning model using Python and TensorFlow to detect brain tumors in MRI images. The model is trained on a large dataset of MRI scans, learning to identify patterns and features associated with healthy brains and those with tumors.

By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model can analyze MRI images and classify them as either showing a healthy brain or indicating the presence of a brain tumor. This automated detection system can assist healthcare professionals in accurately diagnosing brain tumors, leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.

The use of deep learning and CNNs in this project enables the model to learn complex patterns and features from the input data, making it highly effective in identifying brain tumors. The integration of Python and TensorFlow provides a robust and scalable framework for training and deploying the model, making it a valuable tool in the field of medical imaging and diagnostics.

In this project, I have developed two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for detecting brain tumors in MRI images.

The first model is a custom CNN architecture where I manually designed and added the layers. This approach allowed me to have full control over the network structure, enabling customization based on the specific requirements of the task.

The second model utilizes the pre-trained MobileNet CNN architecture from the Keras library. By importing the MobileNet model, I leveraged its powerful feature extraction capabilities and fine-tuned it for brain tumor detection. This approach achieved an impressive accuracy of 96%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical image analysis.

Having two different models provides a comparative analysis and insights into the trade-offs between custom-designed architectures and pre-trained models. It allows for evaluating the strengths and limitations of each approach in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability.

Overall, the combination of a custom CNN model and the MobileNet model showcases the versatility and performance of deep learning techniques in detecting brain tumors from MRI images.
